Game Design Document: Beauty Ice Breaker

1. Game Overview


Title: Beauty Ice Breaker

Genre: Puzzle-Physics


Platform: PC and Mobile (Web-based using HTML5 and Phaser 3)


Target Audience: Casual gamers, fans of cute chibi-style games, and puzzle-physics enthusiasts


Game Concept: In a whimsical frozen world, players use a magical slingshot to launch "cute girl bombs" at ice blocks covering a chibi girl image. By destroying the ice, players reveal the image, aiming to uncover at least 80% within a limited number of shots. The game blends the image-revealing mechanic of "Gals Panic" with the physics-based shooting of "Angry Birds," presented in a charming chibi art style.

2. Story Settings

Theme: Players are on a mission to rescue chibi girls trapped under layers of magical ice in a fantastical, frozen realm. Each level features a unique chibi girl who needs to be freed by shattering the ice blocks covering her image.


Narrative: A mysterious frost has encased adorable chibi girls in ice. Using a magical slingshot and "cute girl bombs," players must carefully aim to break the ice and rescue each girl. Upon completing a level, the chibi girl may display a cheerful animation, such as waving or smiling, to thank the player.

3. Gameplay Mechanics

Objective: Reveal at least 80% of the hidden chibi girl image by destroying ice blocks using a limited number of "cute girl bombs."



Core Mechanics:

Image Revealing: Inspired by "Gals Panic," players uncover a chibi girl image by destroying ice blocks. As blocks are removed, the image becomes clearer, with progress tracked as a percentage.


Shooting and Physics: Players use a slingshot to launch "cute girl bombs," with trajectories and collisions governed by Matter.js physics, similar to "Angry Birds." Bombs can bounce or shatter blocks upon impact.

Ice Blocks:

Appearance: Frosted, semi-transparent sprites, resembling ice cubes or frosty panels.



Properties:

Size: All small half-transparent blocks in all levels.



Durability: Some blocks require multiple hits to destroy. Make them darker color.


Behavior: Later levels may feature moving or regenerating ice blocks.



Physics: Lower friction (e.g., 0.01) to simulate slipperiness, enhancing challenge.



Projectiles ("Cute Girl Bombs"):




Design: Chibi girl sprites with bomb elements, such as a girl holding a sparkling bomb or styled as a bomb with chibi features.


Mechanics: Limited shots per level (5–10, decreasing with difficulty). Players must aim strategically to maximize block destruction.


Scoring:



Base Score: 10 points per percentage of image revealed (e.g., 80% = 800 points).



Shot Bonus: 100 points per unused shot.



Total Score: Sum of base score and shot bonus per level.



Win/Lose Conditions:





Win: Achieve the target reveal percentage (80%) within the shot limit.



Lose: Run out of shots without reaching 80%.



Progression: Completing a level unlocks the next, featuring a new chibi girl image and increased difficulty.

3.1. Girl Bomb Attacks

To add strategic depth, the game includes 10 unique types of "girl bombs," each associated with a different chibi girl character. These bombs offer varied ways to destroy ice blocks, encouraging players to choose the right bomb for each level’s challenges. Below are the 10 bomb types, their effects, and strategic uses:


Bomb Type

Description

Strategic Use





Blast Girl



Creates a large explosion, destroying all ice blocks within a significant radius.



Ideal for clearing dense clusters of ice blocks quickly.





Piercer Girl



Penetrates through multiple ice blocks in a straight line, destroying them sequentially.



Perfect for targeting rows or columns of ice blocks aligned in a straight path.





Shrapnel Girl



Fragments into smaller projectiles upon impact, each destroying a separate ice block.



Effective for hitting multiple scattered ice blocks with a single shot.





Ricochet Girl



Bounces off surfaces, allowing it to hit ice blocks from various angles.



Useful for navigating around obstacles or reaching hard-to-hit ice blocks.





Sticky Girl



Adheres to the first ice block it hits and can be detonated manually or after a delay.



Allows precise timing of explosions, maximizing damage in specific areas.





Melter Girl



Releases a substance that gradually melts ice blocks over time, even after impact.



Great for dealing with large or reinforced ice blocks requiring sustained damage.





Shatterer Girl



Delivers a powerful impact, capable of breaking even the toughest ice blocks.



Essential for levels with particularly durable ice blocks.





Cluster Girl



Disperses several smaller bombs upon explosion, each targeting nearby ice blocks.



Excellent for covering a wide area with multiple smaller explosions.





Freezer Girl



Emits a freezing aura that immobilizes nearby ice blocks for a short duration.



Prevents dynamic ice blocks from moving, making them easier targets.





Heavy Girl



Has high mass, causing displacement that pushes ice blocks into others or off-screen.



Useful for manipulating ice block positions or triggering chain reactions.





Implementation Notes:





Each bomb type can be implemented using Matter.js properties like restitution, density, and collision events.



Players can select bomb types before each shot, with new types unlocked as they progress through levels.
