# Beauty Ice Breaker Game Prototype

A Phaser 3 game prototype that combines the image-revealing mechanics of Gals Panic with the slingshot physics gameplay of Angry Birds.

## Game Description

In Beauty Ice Breaker, you use a slingshot to launch "girl bombs" at ice blocks covering a chibi girl image. By destroying the ice blocks, you progressively reveal the hidden image underneath. Your goal is to reveal at least 80% of the image within a limited number of shots.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: Open `index.html` in a web browser to start the game.
2. **Controls**:
   - Click and drag on the bomb to aim
   - Release to launch the bomb
   - Try to hit and destroy ice blocks covering the image
3. **Objective**: Reveal at least 80% of the hidden chibi girl image using your limited shots.
4. **Win Condition**: Successfully reveal 80% or more of the image before running out of shots.
